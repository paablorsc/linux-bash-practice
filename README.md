# Linux & Bash Practice

This repository contains notes and exercises from my hands-on practice with Linux
and basic Bash usage in lab environments.

The goal is to become comfortable working in the terminal and understanding how
Linux systems operate under the hood.

## Topics covered
- File and directory navigation
- File permissions and ownership
- Searching files using `find`
- Pipes and redirection
- Basic command chaining
- Understanding system structure

## Example skills practiced
- Reading and interpreting command output
- Solving small challenges using terminal tools
- Debugging permission and path issues
- Working efficiently without a GUI

## Learning approach
- Practice-based learning
- Small experiments in isolated environments
- Focus on understanding rather than memorization

## Notes
This repository contains learning notes and examples,
not production scripts.
